# SentinelLink
The Problem: Current phishing detection is reactive, leaving users vulnerable during the "Golden Hour" before links are blacklisted.  Our Solution:  ir-Gapped Rendering: Streams visual pixels via Python backend; no code touches your device.   Decoys: Fills scams with "Honey-tokens". Forensics: PDF reports for Govt/Chakshu with IP data.
